## Overview
Quiz Challenge.
As you proceed in your journey to becoming a front-end web developer, it’s likely that you’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help you become familiar with these tests and give you a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week’s coursework has taught you all the skills you need to succeed in this challenge.

### The challenge

Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * 
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * 
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score

## My process

I started out with psudocode and slowly building one part of the quiz at a time. This built up my confidence getting things to work on the page. Eventually near the end of the quiz I had to rewrite some functions to get things to work together. It was slow but ultimately beneficial.

### Built with
-- HTML
-- CSS
-- JavaScript


### What I learned

Besides technical things such as DOM, local storage (storing and retrieving), JSON, I also felt that I was better able to grasp workflow, and I'm beginning to be able to see how I work best with structuring and building. To me this was one of the most important things I learned during this project. Oh, and console.log EVERYTHING.
